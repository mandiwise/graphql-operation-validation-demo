# GraphQL Operation Validation Action Demo

This repo demos the [GraphQL operation validation GitHub action](https://github.com/mandiwise/graphql-operation-validation-action).

The `.github/workflows/operations.yml` file shows how this action can be used to validate operations against a local schema as well as a remote schema that requires a token for authentication.
